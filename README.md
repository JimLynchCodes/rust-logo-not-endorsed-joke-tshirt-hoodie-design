This repo contains the designs for a tshirt about Rust programming.



## Why It's Funny

The fine print is supposed to be a joke making fun of the whole controversy in ~2023 (more info on that), but if you look at the Rust Toundation's [_Logo Policy and Media Guide_](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/logo-policy-and-media-guide/) it actually does allow you to use the Rust logo for "Using the Rust trademarks on t-shirts, hats, and other artwork or merchandise, even in modified form, is allowed for your personal use or for use by a small group of community members, as long as they are not sold." So, we're good. üòâ üëç

## Learn Rust
Steve Jokbs said that everyone should learn to code because it *teaches you how to think.*

Well, Rust will make you think alright! In the good ways though.

## Files
Think repo contains png files meant to be uploaded to your shirt printer, and it also contains the original vector project files for sketch app.

## v2
After I printed the v1 image the Rust logo seemd a little close to the top of the shirt and the letters seemed a bit too far apart horizontally so those things were tweaked in the v2.
